<!-- If files from your camera cannot be opened by RawTherapee, or the colors do not look right, you can provide us with information to improve support for your camera. Before requesting making a request, please read http://rawpedia.rawtherapee.com/Adding_Support_for_New_Raw_Formats and make sure to provide the necessary shots.
If you own a color calibration target (such as an X-Rite ColorChecker Passport), you can further improve the color rendition of files from your camera. Please read http://rawpedia.rawtherapee.com/How_to_create_DCP_color_profiles and provide the necessary shots.

Requests for support or color calibration without providing the necessary information will be deleted. -->
