-----------------------------
This is RawTherapee 5.1 stable, released on 2017-05-15.

News Relevant to Photographers
------------------------------
- RawTherapee supports most raw formats, including some unusual ones like those from cameras using Foveon and X-Trans sensors. If you're wondering whether it supports your camera's raw format, first download RawTherapee and try for yourself. If a raw format is not supported it will either not open, or the preview in the Editor tab will appear black, white, or have a strong color cast - usually magenta. In that case, read the "Adding Support for New Raw Formats" RawPedia article.

In order to use RawTherapee efficiently you should know that:
- You can scroll all panels using the mouse scroll-wheel.
- You can right-click on a tool's name to automatically expand it while collapsing all others.
- To change slider values or drop-down list items with the mouse scroll-wheel, hold the Shift key. This is so that you can safely scroll the panels without accidentally changing a slider or other tool setting.
- All curves support the Shift and Ctrl keys while dragging a point. Shift+drag makes the point snap to meaningful axes (top, bottom, diagonal, other), while Ctrl+drag makes your mouse movement super-fine for precise point positioning.
- There are many keyboard shortcuts which make working with RawTherapee much faster and give you greater control. Make sure you familiarize yourself with them on RawPedia's "Keyboard Shortcuts" page!

New features since 5.0:
- Pentax Pixel Shift support, to automatically combine sub-images from a Pentax Pixel Shift raw file into one high quality image.
- Support for processing any sub-image from raw formats which support multiple images. Currently up to 4 sub-images supported.
- Dynamic Profile Creator to automatically generate per-image custom processing profiles by merging existing processing profiles based on image metadata (Exif).
- New command-line executable "rawtherapee-cli(.exe)" to reduce startup time for command-line operations.
- HaldCLUT paths are now relative to the HaldCLUT folder as set in Preferences. This enables you to share PP3 files easier.
- Auto White Balance now has a Temperature Bias, letting you make the automatic temperature warmer or cooler.
- LCP correction works for raw and non-raw files.
- LCP distortion correction support for fisheye lenses.
- Certain tools are now hidden or disabled if the loaded image does not support them, e.g. the tools in the Raw tab are disabled when working with a non-raw file.
- New zoom levels for the main preview in the Editor tab.
- New Fast Export option to downscale the image before processing, to increase speed.
- Custom crop ratio.
- Automatic monitor profile detection also in Linux.
- Lens information support added for Panasonic cameras.
- Support for lossy DNG files.
- Support for compressed Fujifilm Bayer raw files.
- Support for compressed X-Trans raw files.
- Support for Sigma sd Quattro DNG raw files.

News Relevant to Developers
---------------------------
- Announce and discuss your plans in GitHub before starting work.

- Use C++11.
- Code must be run through astyle.
