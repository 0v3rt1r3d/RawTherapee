RAWTHERAPEE 5.3 RELEASE NOTES
-----------------------------
This is RawTherapee 5.3 stable, released on 2017-09-30.

RawTherapee provides you with a selection of powerful tools with which you can practice the art of developing raw photos. Be sure to read RawPedia to understand how each tool works so that you may make the most of it.

A great place to start is the "Getting Started" article. Click on "Main page" in the top-left corner when you have finished reading that article to see all other articles.

News Relevant to Photographers
------------------------------
RawTherapee supports most raw formats, including Pentax Pixel Shift, Canon Dual-Pixel, and those from Foveon and X-Trans sensors.
If you're wondering whether it supports your camera's raw format, first download RawTherapee and try for yourself. If a raw format is not supported it will either not open, or the preview in the Editor tab will appear black, white, or have a strong color cast - usually magenta. In that case, read the "Adding Support for New Raw Formats" RawPedia article.

In order to use RawTherapee efficiently you should know that:
- You can scroll all panels using the mouse scroll-wheel.
- You can right-click on a tool's name to automatically expand it while collapsing all others.
- To change slider values or drop-down list items with the mouse scroll-wheel, hold the Shift key. This is so that you can safely scroll the panels without accidentally changing a slider or other tool setting.
- All curves support the Shift and Ctrl keys while dragging a point. Shift+drag makes the point snap to meaningful axes (top, bottom, diagonal, other), while Ctrl+drag makes your mouse movement super-fine for precise point positioning.
- There are many keyboard shortcuts which make working with RawTherapee much faster and give you greater control. Make sure you familiarize yourself with them on RawPedia's "Keyboard Shortcuts" page!

New features since 5.2:
- CIECAM02 enhanced with control over the scene and viewing conditions.
- CIECAM02-friendly "Average Surround" color theme and L* middle gray preview background color, takes into account human vision and color appearance with regard to the surrounding color.
- Manually save the collapsed/expanded state of tools.
- Lensfun support, for automatic (and manual) profiled lens correction.
- ACES, DCI-P3 Theater and DCI-P3 D65 output color profiles.
- Numerous speed optimizations and bug fixes.

News Relevant to Package Maintainers
------------------------------------
In general:
- Requires GTK+ version >=3.16, though 3.22 is recommended.
- RawTherapee 5 requires GCC-4.9 or higher, or Clang.
- Do not use -ffast-math, it will not make RawTherapee faster but will introduce artifacts.
- Use -O3, it will make RawTherapee faster with no known side-effects.
- For stable releases use -DCACHE_NAME_SUFFIX=""
- For development builds and release-candidates use -DCACHE_NAME_SUFFIX="5-dev"

Changes since 5.2:
- Lensfun is required. To use the system-wide lensfun database, do not set the CMake option -DLENSFUNDBDIR. To use a custom lensfun database, set -DLENSFUNDBDIR="path/to/database". See the compilation instructions in RawPedia for more information.

News Relevant to Developers
---------------------------
- Announce and discuss your plans in GitHub before starting work.
- Keep branches small so that completed and working features can be merged into the "dev" branch often, and so that they can be abandoned if they head in the wrong direction.
- Use C++11.
